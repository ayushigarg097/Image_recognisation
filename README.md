# Image_recognition
CNN code to image recognition
This project consists of a dataset of images of cats and dogs.Here the machine is being trained to recognise 
any given picture of a cat or a dog by the user.Here there are two processes going on , namely "testing and training" , for 
example 8000 sets of both the animals are being trained in the machine and after the completion, 2000 times the machine 
is being tested that whether it has been sucessfully trained or not.
